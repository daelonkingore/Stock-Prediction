# Stock-Prediction
This was the final project for my AI class Junior year of college. It uses Tensorflow and data mining libraries along with old stock data from Yahoo Finance to train a model on predicting a specific stock. There is no UI, you have to change the stock ticker in the code and re-run the entire jupyter notebook to get the graphs. Unfortunately, like most if not all stock prediction tools, this one has a 50% chance of getting a correct prediction. 

This project was coded alongside Ashton Barnwell, but the majority of the code was created by me, Daelon Kingore.
